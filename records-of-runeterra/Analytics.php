	This page would have all the analytics<br>
	if we were better and faster at programming.<br>
	This page would include records such as each cards/champion win rate,<br>
	most played deck and so much more. We thought that<br>
	these statistics could help dedicated players see what\'s going<br>
	on in the game and we were hoping it would add a new level of<br>
	strategy to the already strategic game. You could use these stats to see<br>
	what the meta is like in the game or even the way its shifting. It would be<br>
	split up by region and we assumed that it would only be beneficial if ranked<br>
	was the game mode that was kept up with. This way you can filter the stats<br>
	by rank since different cards will most likely have different win rates in each rank.<br>
	This isn\'t going to give a player a massive advantage over their opponents in game but<br>
	could still help dedicated players climb and stay ahead of other non-dedicated players in a strategic manner.
